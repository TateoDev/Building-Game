Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:
You'll probably have to add in some instances that weren't created using Rojo
```bash
rojo build -o "Build-My-Avatar.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Build-My-Avatar.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
